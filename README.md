# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.

Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.

We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with preprocessing and cleaning of the raw text of the tweets. Then we will explore the cleaned text and try to get some intuition about the context of the tweets. After that, we will extract numerical features from the data and finally use these feature sets to train models and identify the sentiments of the tweets.

This is one of the most interesting challenges in NLP so Iâ€™m very excited to take this journey with you!

# Problem Statement 
The main objective of this thesis is to do sentiment analysis of politician timeline
tweets which they have tweeted during the election campaign and also include to
find out tweets sentiment in which these politicians are tagged like how people are
thought and reacting about these politician timeline tweets.
By using word cloud we can also find out keyword for this project. And this will
help use to understand what is the top priority of the leader.
Therefore to get this goal, We will create a model to predict the sentiment of
the tweets. And this model will help in predicting the sentiment and what is the
accuracy by using different machine learning algorithms.


## Introduction
The project requires authentication via the Twitter API. A new application needs to be created to get the necessary keys. A few libraries also need to be installed for the script to run properly.
