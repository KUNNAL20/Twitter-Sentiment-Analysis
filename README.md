# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
A Python script that analyses sentiment on a given topic from tweets data provided by Twitter

## Introduction
People are paying attention to Twitter, Facebook, and Whatsapp these days, and
they are becoming very popular among them. Sentiment analysis offers numerous
chances for developing a new application. Sentiment analysis has a huge impact on
the industrial field, such as government organisations and large corporations, who
want to know what consumer think about their product and its brand value. The
goal of sentiment analysis is to extract a person’s behaviour, mood and opinion
from the text. Opinion Mining techniques are
used to determine peoples opinions on social media. Twitter is also a large platform
where different ideas, thoughts, and opinions are presented and exchanged. People
comment, praise, debate, and argue regardless of their origins or religious beliefs,
whether they are poor or rich, uneducated or educated.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of computer science that explores
the creation of systems that can interact with people in simple language. It is
concerned with ways for analysing, computing, and representing data at various
levels of language analysis to make machines handle data in the same way that
humans do for various fields and applications. NLP algorithms are heavily reliant on
or rely on machine learning techniques, the most important of which are numerical
or statistical. 

This is one of the most interesting challenges in NLP so I’m very excited to take this journey with you!

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this thesis is to do sentiment analysis of politician timeline
tweets which they have tweeted during the election campaign and also include to
find out tweets sentiment in which these politicians are tagged like how people are
thought and reacting about these politician timeline tweets.
By using word cloud we can also find out keyword for this project. And this will
help use to understand what is the top priority of the leader.
Therefore to get this goal, We will create a model to predict the sentiment of
the tweets. And this model will help in predicting the sentiment and what is the
accuracy by using different machine learning algorithms.
